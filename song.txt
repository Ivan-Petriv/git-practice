I hope I find peace in the noise
Wanna become one of them city boys
They're all so pretty and so advanced
Maybe they also know our dance

Bye mom, bye dad
Meow, cat, please meow back
Don't cry, just dance
Rim tim tagi digi dim tim tim

There's no going back
My presence fades to black
Yeah, there's no going back
My anxiety attacks
Rim tim tagi digi dim tim tagi digi

There's no going back
My presence fades to black
Yeah, there's no going back
My anxiety attacks
Rim tim tagi digi dim tim tagi digi

One thousand burning arrows
Fill the starlit sky

The ship glides gently on the waves
As day turns into night
